# 🛡️ Cyber Studio, By Taco_Devlopz

Cyber Studio is an open-source Roblox education project focused on teaching secure scripting, game system design, and exploit prevention through safe, interactive lessons.
This project is designed to help Roblox developers build more secure, maintainable, and well-structured games by understanding how systems should be designed — not how to exploit them.


🎯 Purpose
Many Roblox games are exploited not because developers are careless, but because security and structure are rarely taught.
Cyber Studio exists to:
Teach client vs server authority
Show how exploits happen without enabling them
Promote best practices for scripting and data safety
Encourage reusable, organized systems
Reduce exploitation and black-market abuse on Roblox
This project focuses on prevention, not hacking.


📚 What You’ll Learn
Cyber Studio covers topics such as:
Client vs server logic
Script structure and organization
Data protection and validation
Remote event safety
Reusable systems and ModuleScripts
Exploit prevention patterns
General developer security awareness
Lessons are structured by skill level:
Beginner
Intermediate
Advanced


🧪 How Learning Works
Cyber Studio uses:
Interactive lessons
Safe simulations
Visual feedback
Structured challenges
There are no real exploits, no cheating tools, and no instructions for bypassing Roblox systems.
All scenarios are controlled, educational, and designed to demonstrate defensive techniques only.

🔒 Safety & Ethics
Cyber Studio does NOT teach hacking, exploiting, or cheating.
No exploit code is provided
No bypass methods are taught
No real attack techniques are demonstrated
The goal is to help developers defend their games, understand risks, and write safer code.


👥 Who This Is For
Cyber Studio is intended for:
Roblox developers with basic LuaU knowledge
Developers who want to improve security and structure
Creators who want to learn best practices
Anyone interested in how Roblox systems work safely
This is not a beginner LuaU tutorial.
If you are new to scripting, learning the basics first is recommended.

📂 Open Source
Cyber Studio is fully open source.
You are welcome to:
Read the code
Learn from it
Reuse parts of it
Fork it to make your own educational version
Please use this project responsibly and in alignment with Roblox’s rules and community standards.


📌 Recommended Prerequisites
If you are new to scripting, consider learning:
LuaU basics
Variables, functions, and events
Basic Roblox Studio workflow
Once comfortable, Cyber Studio is designed to help you go further.


🚀 Status
Cyber Studio is actively developed and will continue to expand with new lessons and systems over time.
Some content may be marked as Coming Soon as the curriculum grows.


🏁 Final Notes
This project is built to:
Improve the Roblox developer ecosystem
Promote safer games
Encourage clean, maintainable code

Educate responsibly

If you contribute, please keep these goals in mind.
